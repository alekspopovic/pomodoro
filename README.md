This is the code used in my tutorial on how to build an infinite Pomodoro timer in React. Pomodoro is a time management technique in which you work for a set amount of time (e.g. 25 minutes), then you take a small break (e.g. 5 minutes) and then you repeat this cycle. In classic Pomodoro you would work for 4 cycles total and then take a longer break, but in this simplified version we are going to build a time tracker that repeats infinitely.
